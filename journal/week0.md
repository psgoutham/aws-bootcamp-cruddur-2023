# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

## Required Homework

### Billing Considerations
The pricing of aws services varies depending on the region. Make sure to use the region close to you and see if all services you will utilise are available for the region. And also make sure you set the billing alarm so you don't have unexpected costs.
I am using the free tier account, which has been created newly for this bootcamp. Also I have some credit available which I have added to the AWS account. I will be using the us-east-1 for the workloads. 

### Billing Alerts and Budget
Billing metric data is stored in the US East (N. Virginia) Region and represents worldwide charges. This data includes the estimated charges for every service in AWS that you use, in addition to the estimated overall total of your AWS charges.
The alarm triggers when your account billing exceeds the threshold you specify. It triggers only when the current billing exceeds the threshold. It doesn't use projections based on your usage so far in the month.

AWS Budgets mprove planning and cost control with flexible budgeting and forecasting. I have created budgets for monthly charges and set thresholds for alarms accordingly when the threshold exceeds or when a forecast also exceed the budget I will be notified my email id.
